Setting Up the Project
The node_modules directory contains all the dependencies required to run the project. 
However, to set up the project on your system, you need to install certain frameworks and tools.
Follow these steps:

Install Node.js:
Download and install Node.js. Ensure you install a version compatible with your project (e.g., Node.js 16.x.x).

Install Expo CLI:
Open a terminal and run the following command to globally install Expo CLI:
npm install -g expo-cli

Install Project Dependencies:
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies by running:
npm install

Start the App:
Launch the app by running:
npx expo start
