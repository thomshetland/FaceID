# FaceID Security Application | Python, React Native, Flask

## Overview
The FaceID Security Application is an innovative security solution designed to accurately authenticate users based on their facial features. Built using a combination of Python, React Native, and Flask, this application utilizes state-of-the-art machine vision techniques, including Dlib's 68-point facial landmark detection and convolutional neural networks (CNN), to provide a seamless and secure user authentication experience.

## Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes Dlib's facial landmark detection and a pre-trained CNN to accurately recognize and authenticate registered users.
- **Handling Challenging Scenarios**: The system is designed to work effectively under varied conditions, including occlusions, varied angles, lighting changes, and distances.
- **High Accuracy**: A CNN-based embedding model generates 128-dimensional feature vectors for each face, ensuring precise user identification by comparing these vectors' distances in high-dimensional space.
- **Cross-Platform**: The app is built with React Native, ensuring it runs efficiently on both Android and iOS platforms.
- **Backend with Flask**: The server-side logic is implemented with Flask, enabling secure communication and processing of authentication requests.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For machine vision and facial recognition logic.
- **React Native**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.
- **Flask**: For the backend to handle API requests and user authentication.
- **Dlib**: For facial landmark detection.
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)**: For generating 128-dimensional feature vectors and improving recognition accuracy.

## Key Components
1. **Dlibâ€™s 68-point facial landmark detection**: Used to detect key points on the face for accurate alignment and analysis.
2. **Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Used to handle complex challenges such as different angles, lighting variations, and partial occlusions.
3. **128-Dimensional Feature Vectors**: Generated by the CNN embedding model for each user, enabling accurate authentication by comparing vector distances.
4. **Authentication Process**: The system compares the feature vectors to those stored in the database, ensuring the correct user is authenticated.
