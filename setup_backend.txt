To set up the backend a conda environment needs to be created.

This can be done with the command;

                    "conda env create -f environment.yml"

If this causes errors, please use Linux (Ubuntu distro or WSL ubuntu) and conda and create and environment using the command;

                     "conda create --name jamaIOIO --file requirements.txt"
